# Image Based Plant Disease Prediction and Advising Pesticides

## Overview
This repository contains the project **“Image Based Plant Disease Prediction and Advising Pesticides”**, developed as part of the Bachelor of Technology program in **Computer Science and Engineering**.  
The system uses **deep learning (CNN)** and image processing to identify plant leaf diseases and recommend suitable pesticides, improving early detection and agricultural productivity.

## Abstract
Plant diseases cause major losses to farmers every year. The goal of this project is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically identify plant leaf diseases and advise effective remedies or pesticides.  
By analyzing digital images, the model detects disease categories and provides targeted treatment recommendations. This project improves precision agriculture by automating disease diagnosis, reducing manual effort, and enhancing crop health management.
